"""AppleMusicSongsPage: every song in the library as a table, sorted by any column and filtered
as you type.

The chain is library.songs → the songs in the chosen column's order (library.SongOrder) → those
matching the filter → a Gio.ListStore of the rows shown → Gtk.SingleSelection →
Gtk.ColumnView. Ordering and filtering happen in Python rather than in a Gtk.SortListModel and
Gtk.FilterListModel because GTK's are slow over Python objects; measured on 30,000 songs
(scripts/demo_library.py --albums 2500):

- GTK's sorters and filters read each track's properties from C, about 3 µs a read into Python.
  The view's Gtk.ColumnViewSorter has no sort keys, so a Gtk.SortListModel over it compares
  pairs and reads both tracks at every comparison: 1.6 to 6 s a click. SongOrder sorts with
  keys it computes once: 5 to 60 ms.
- A Gtk.AnyFilter of three Gtk.StringFilters refilters once per sub-filter it changes: up to
  1.1 s a keystroke; one Gtk.StringFilter over the three fields still takes 60 ms a pass.
  Testing each track's folded search key (Track.search_key) in Python takes 13 ms.
- Whichever model filters, a Gtk.ColumnView keeps 200 rows of widgets alive, and when a change
  removes the items they show it destroys them and builds new ones, about 0.5 ms a row: 100 ms
  and more on the first keystroke. _show() replaces the rows in an order that lets it recycle
  them instead (inserting, moving the view, then removing), so it only rebinds them.

In all, a click re-sorts the table in 30 to 50 ms and a keystroke refilters it in 10 to 50 ms,
rebinding included.

Clicking a column header, or choosing in the header's Sort By menu (the keyboard's way: the
headers take no focus), re-sorts. The filter is a Gtk.SearchBar under the header bar, as
GNOME's apps have one: the header's Filter Songs button, Ctrl+F (focus_filter()) and typing on
the page (the page is the bar's key-capture widget) show it, Escape or the button closes it,
which clears its entry and so the filter; typing in it refilters (after the entry's own short
delay), and the new count is announced. A sync that changes the songs brings the rows up
to date with the fewest splices (library.apply_diff), so the table keeps its scroll position;
only a new sort or filter starts it again from the top. Activating a row (Enter, a click: the
view's single-click-activate, docs/decisions.md) asks the window to play it; a right click, a
long press or the Menu key opens its context menu, and a row drags onto a sidebar playlist
(widgets/context_menu.py). The artist and the album are links to their pages
(widgets/track_links.py). The table keeps no selection (a Gtk.NoSelection): GTK selects the
hovered row of a single-click list, which would have followed the pointer around.

The row of the song playing is marked (SongTitle's play icon and bold title, "Playing" as
the row's accessible description): the page follows the Player's `notify::track` while it is
shown, through the title cells and the rows it has bound (widgets/track_row.py's
PlayingMark), and catches up as it maps.
