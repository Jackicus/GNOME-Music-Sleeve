# The backend

Everything that reaches Chrome, MusicKit or Apple's API, below the app's `Engine`
(`src/engine.py`). The standard library and asyncio only: nothing here imports gi
(`tests/test_backend.py` checks), and importing the package imports none of its modules. The
app reaches Chrome only through the Engine; other modules may import the pure parts (`api`,
`config`, `errors`, `normalize`, `store`).

## What is here

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `errors.py` | `EngineError(code, message, status=None, musickit_code=None)`, the one error that leaves the backend, and its codes |
| `api.py` | the Apple Music API apart from any connection: library ids, an item's endpoint, resource types, the endpoints the pages use, Apple's `{errors}` answers as an `EngineError` (`api_error()`), and which failures are final (`is_final()`) |
| `chrome.py` | finding Chrome (`find_chrome()`), its argv (`chrome_args()`: `--remote-debugging-pipe`, `--headless=new`, an `--app=` window when visible; `flatpak-spawn --host` from a Flatpak sandbox), its environment (`chrome_environment()`: the session bus of `APPLE_MUSIC_HOST_SESSION_BUS`), whether a profile's `Local State` records the keyring's key (`profile_used_keyring()`), which Chrome holds a profile (`profile_owner()`, from its `SingletonLock`), `select_page()`, and `get_json()` for the developer attach |
| `client.py` | the transports (`PipeTransport`, Chrome's DevTools pipe on its descriptors 3 and 4; `WebSocketTransport`, a DevTools port) and `CDPClient`: one asynchronous CDP connection attached to the music.apple.com page, its calls, events, and the bridge kept in the page across navigations |
| `cdp.py` | the RFC 6455 handshake and frame codec as pure functions, for `WebSocketTransport`, and `exception_message()`, a page's JavaScript exception in one line |
| `bridge.js` | the only code that runs in the page: `window.__appleMusicLibrary` over the page's MusicKit instance, and MusicKit's events posted through the `__amEvent` binding |
| `normalize.py` | Apple's answers as the library's Item, Track and shelf shapes; the artwork cache (naming, fetching, pruning); library.json; the kept answers; `prune_caches()` |
| `store.py` | every write into the cache: `atomic_write()` / `atomic_create()`, the cache's generation (`cache_generation()`, `bump_cache_generation()`), `CacheGone` and `Cancelled` |
| `config.py` | the cache and profile directories for each build profile, the developer's DevTools port, Chrome's session bus when the app runs on another (`host_session_bus()`), the artwork sizes, `BRIDGE_JS` |

## Error codes

`backend/errors.py`; `src/errors.py`'s `error_message()` gives each one its sentence and button.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `engine-down` | Chrome is not running, exited, or the connection closed (also every command in demo mode) |
| `no-browser` | no Google Chrome to run, or it could not be started |
| `no-keyring` | the keyring that encrypts the profile's sign-in is not reachable on Chrome's session bus: Chrome was not started, as it would delete the sign-in |
| `not-signed-in` | MusicKit is not authorized |
| `api` | Apple, MusicKit or the page said no (`status`: Apple's HTTP status; `musickit_code`: MusicKit's code for a refused play) |
| `timeout` | Chrome or the page took too long |
| `usage` | a bad argument (`scripts/am.py`) |

## The bridge

`client.load_bridge()` injects `bridge.js` with its hash as `__appleMusicLibraryWanted`: the same
file injected twice is a no-op, a changed one replaces the old. `CDPClient.bridge(name, *args)`
calls `window.__appleMusicLibrary.<name>(...)`; the Engine's commands are thin calls into these.

| Call | Answer |
|---|---|
| `status()` | `{ready, engine, authorized, storefront, bitrate}` |
| `accountName()` | the account's name as the page shows it (`.account-menu .user__name`), or null; null while a sign-in control is on the page |
| `signin()` | `mk.authorize()`, then `{authorized}` |
| `signout()` | `mk.unauthorize()`, which revokes the session at Apple's end: `{ok: true}` or `{error}`, never a throw |
| `api(path, params, options)`, `apiAll(paths)` | the API's answer body (`mk.api.music()`); `apiAll` answers null in place of a failed read |
| `play(kind, id, {startWith, startId, shuffle})` | `{ok: true}` (with `moved: {from, to}` when the queue held another item than `startId` at `startWith` and was moved to it), or `{error, code}` when MusicKit refuses. `kind`: `album playlist station song musicVideo artist songs` (`songs`: ids joined by commas; `artist`: its top songs, else its station). `shuffle` true turns shuffle on, false off, null leaves it |
| `playNext(kind, id)`, `playLater(kind, id)` | `{ok: true}` |
| `control(action)` | `play pause toggle next previous stop`: `{ok: true}` |
| `seek(seconds)` | `{ok: true}` |
| `volume(level)` | `{volume}`: MusicKit's level after the set (0 to 1; the page keeps it) |
| `shuffle(on\|off\|toggle)`, `repeat(none\|one\|all\|cycle)` | `{shuffle, repeat}` |
| `nowPlaying()` | `{state, track, position, duration, shuffle, repeat, volume}`; `state` is MusicKit's `PlaybackStates` name |
| `queue()` | `{index, items: [Track]}` |
| `queueJump(index)` | `{ok: true}` (`mk.changeToMediaAtIndex`) |
| `rating(kind, id, love)`, `addToLibrary(kind, id)`, `addToPlaylist(playlistId, songId, type)` | `{ok: true}`, or a throw with Apple's status and message. Writes go through `mk.api.client.createRequest(...).send()`: Apple answers them 202 or 204 with no body, which `music()` cannot read (a body Apple does send comes back as `data`) |
| `createPlaylist(attributes, tracks, parentId)` | `{id}`, the new playlist's; `attributes` `{name, description?}`, `tracks` `[{id, type}]` |
| `updatePlaylist(id, attributes)`, `deletePlaylist(id)`, `removeFromPlaylist(id, type, trackId)`, `replacePlaylistTracks(id, tracks)`, `updateFolder(id, attributes)`, `deleteFolder(id)` | `{ok: true}`, or a throw as above (the requests below) |
| `lyrics(catalogSongId)` | `{synced, lines: [{startMs, endMs, text, stanza?}]}` (the TTML read with the page's XML parser; `stanza: true` on a verse's first line) |
| `search(term, limit)`, `suggest(term, limit)`, `searchLanding()`, `category(id)` | the API's answer, shaped by `normalize.search_results()`, `search_suggestions()`, `search_landing()`, `category_page()` |
| `playlistSuggestions(playlistId, limit, offered, selected, previewed)` | `{results: {suggested: [songs]}}`, the songs Apple suggests adding to a library playlist, shaped by `normalize.playlist_suggestions()`: music.apple.com's own request (checked against the API on 2026-10-08), `POST /v1/me/recommendations/suggested?contexts=playlist-suggested-songs&types=songs&limit=<limit>` with `{targetContent: {id, type: 'library-playlists'}}`, through the request builder (`music()` sends no body); up to `limit` (20 by default) full catalog songs. With `offered` (catalog ids shown) or `selected` (those added) the body also carries `offered: {suggested: [{id, type: 'songs', meta: {impressed: true, previewed}}]}` (`previewed` true for the ids in `previewed`, those whose preview was played) and `selected: [{id, type: 'songs', meta: {source: 'suggested'}}]`, as the web player's Refresh sends them; Apple then answers none of the offered songs (checked 2026-10-08) |
| `preview(id, url)` | `{ok: true, id}` once Apple's 30-second clip of a song (`url`, https: the song's `previews[0].url`, kept as `previewUrl`) plays, or `{error, code}` (`NO_PREVIEW` for no https address, else the media error's name, such as `NotAllowedError`). MusicKit is paused first and its queue left alone: the clip plays in an `Audio` element of the page's own, at MusicKit's volume (`volume()` sets both), one at a time. `play()` and every `control()` stop it, and so does MusicKit playing again (`previewDidChange` follows each start and end) |
| `stopPreview()` | `{stopped}`: whether a preview was playing |
| `subscribe()`, `unsubscribe()` | MusicKit's listeners on or off, once per instance |

### The playlist writes

Found in music.apple.com's own code (its `requestCreateNewPlaylist`,
`requestUpdatePlaylist`, `requestRemoveFromPlaylist`, `requestUpdatePlaylistTracks`,
`requestMoveToFolder` and `requestDeleteFromLibrary`) and checked against a real account on
2026-10-03, on playlists and folders made for the check and deleted after it:

| Request | Apple's answer |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/me/library/playlists` `{attributes: {name, description?}, relationships: {tracks: {data: [{id, type}]}, parent: {data: [{id, type: 'library-playlist-folders'}]}}}` | 201 with the new playlist; both relationships may be left out (an empty playlist at the top level). Listed by the listings 4 to 6.5 s later |
| `PATCH /v1/me/library/playlists/<id>` `{attributes: {name?, description?}}` | 204; either attribute alone; listed within a second |
| `DELETE /v1/me/library/playlists/<id>/tracks?ids[library-songs]=<id>&mode=all` | 204: every entry of that song goes. The tracks of a library playlist are `library-songs` (or `library-music-videos`) by the song's own `i.` id, and carry no id of the entry |
| `PUT /v1/me/library/playlists/<id>/tracks` `{data: [{id, type}]}` | 204: the list replaced whole, in that order (the web player's reorder); one entry of a song held twice is removed so |
| `DELETE /v1/me/library/playlists/<id>` | 204. A playlist is still listed for minutes after, nameless (`api.is_deleted`), and a second DELETE is a 500 |
| `PUT /v1/me/library/playlists/<id>/parent` `{data: [{id: <folder>, type: 'library-playlist-folders'}]}` | 204: moved into the folder (not used yet) |
| `POST /v1/me/library/playlist-folders` `{attributes: {name}}` | 201 with the folder (not used yet: the web player makes none) |
| `PATCH /v1/me/library/playlist-folders/<id>` `{attributes: {name}}` | 204, although Apple lists every folder with `canEdit` false |
| `DELETE /v1/me/library/playlist-folders/<id>` | 204, the folder and what is in it gone; but playlists deleted with their folder stayed listed, nameless, for more than half an hour, where one deleted by itself left the listing within minutes: `Engine.delete_folder()` deletes the contents first |

A playlist the user may change lists `canEdit` and `canDelete` true; Favourite Songs both
false; one of Apple's added to the library `canEdit` false, `canDelete` true. The listing
carries a playlist's `description` when it has one.

## Events

The client dispatches each bridge event as `am:<name>`; the Engine re-emits it as
`event(name, data)`. The data is read from the instance at the moment of the event.

| Event | Data |
|---|---|
| `authorizationStatusDidChange` | `{authorized, status}` |
| `playbackStateDidChange` | `{state, position, duration}`; a play walks `playing`, `waiting`, `loading`, `playing` |
| `nowPlayingItemDidChange` | `{track: Track or null, index}` |
| `playbackTimeDidChange` | `{position, duration}` in seconds, about four times a second while playing |
| `playbackDurationDidChange` | `{duration}` |
| `queueItemsDidChange` | `{index, items: [Track]}` (index -1 before playback starts) |
| `queuePositionDidChange` | `{index, oldIndex}` |
| `shuffleModeDidChange`, `repeatModeDidChange` | `{shuffle: "on"\|"off"}`, `{repeat: "none"\|"one"\|"all"}` |
| `playbackVolumeDidChange` | `{volume}` |
| `mediaPlaybackError` | `{code, message}` (`code`: MusicKit's `errorCode`, such as `CONTENT_UNAVAILABLE`, else '') |
| `previewDidChange` | `{id}` as a preview starts; `{id: null, ended, reason}` as it stops (`ended` its id; `reason` `ended`, `error`, `stopped`, `replaced` or `playback`, MusicKit taken in hand). The bridge's own, not MusicKit's |
| `bridgeReset` | `{}`: the client's own, after it put the bridge back into a new document |

## library.json

`<cache>/library.json`, written by `src/sync.py` (and `scripts/demo_library.py`), read by
`src/library.py`. Version 2: an album's track `index` counts on across its discs; the app
syncs an older file again at once.

```

An artist's page (`Engine.artist_page()`, `normalize.artist_page()`) is
`{id, artist, latest: {key, title, item} | null, topSongs: {key, title, items, more} | null,
shelves: [{key, title, items, more}]}`: `artist` an Item without groups whose `summary` is
the biography, with `origin`, `bornOrFormed` (Apple's own words) and `isGroup` where Apple
has them; `latest` the featured or latest release, with its `releaseDate`; the top songs
song Items with their `album`; each shelf one of the artist's views in music.apple.com's
order, titled as Apple titles it, `more` when `Engine.artist_view()` has more of it. A
video about the artist (an interview, a film) is a `link` Item: its `url` is its page,
its subtitle its length, and it has nothing to play.

A playlist's suggested songs (`Engine.playlist_suggestions()`,
`normalize.playlist_suggestions()`) are `{items: [Item]}`: song Items as the top songs are
(with their `album`), in Apple's order, each once. Apple may suggest a song the playlist
holds; the playlist page leaves those out. The first answer (16 songs: the most a page
shows, twelve, and four spare) is kept for a day; a Refresh's replaces it; `more=True`
asks for a few more beside them, unkept. Each kept answer carries `basis`, the page's
`suggestions.basis()` of the songs the playlist held when it was asked: one kept for other
songs (one added or removed since, here or elsewhere and synced) is not fresh, and Apple is
asked again; it is answered `stale` only when Apple cannot be asked.

The app shows none of the data's own words: a missing name is '', the app names shelves by
key, writes the captions from the counts and titles an album's discs from `discNumber`. A song without an album of its own sits under a stand-in album
(`l.alb_…`) that plays `{"kind": "songs", "id": "<id>,<id>…"}`; a video plays as MusicKit's
`musicVideo`. Older files may hold an English `countLabel` or `sections.songs` (loose Tracks);
the model still reads both.

## The caches

All under `config.cache_dir()`, every file written through `store.py` (a dot-named temporary
file beside it, renamed over it; directories 0700, files 0600), with the writer's cache
generation, so a write after Clear Cache or sign-out lands nowhere.

| Path | Written by | Read by | Kept |
|---|---|---|---|
| `library.json` | the sync | `library.py` | until the next sync |
| `art/`, `thumb/`, `art/.sizes` | the sync (thumbnails), the pages (covers) | the artwork loader | pruned against library.json after every sync |
| `remote-art/` | `src/remote.py`, `Engine.item()` | the pages, MPRIS | trimmed to 32 MB, oldest first |
| `lyrics/<id>.json` | `Engine.lyrics()` | the same | fetched again after 30 days; the 2,000 played last |
| `landing.json`, `categories/`, `browse.json`, `made-for-you.json`, `artists/`, `suggestions/` | `Engine._kept_answer()` | the same, `cache.read_kept()` | a day (a playlist's suggestions only while it holds the same songs, their `basis`); an older one only when Apple cannot be asked (`stale: True`); in demo mode, only what the demo library invented (marked `demo`), at any age |

`normalize.prune_caches()` runs after the library's first load and after every sync; it also
removes what older versions kept (`items/`) and temporary files over an hour old.

## Environment

Read by `config.py` on every call:

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `APPLE_MUSIC_CACHE` | the cache directory (default `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/apple-music`, `apple-music-devel` for the development build) |
| `APPLE_MUSIC_PROFILE` | Chrome's profile (default `$XDG_DATA_HOME/apple-music/chrome`, `chrome-devel` for the development build) |
| `APPLE_MUSIC_DEBUG_PORT` | also opens a DevTools port on 127.0.0.1, for `scripts/am.py --attach`. Developers only: while it is set, any local program can drive the signed-in session |
| `APPLE_MUSIC_HOST_SESSION_BUS` | the D-Bus address Chrome runs with as its session bus when the app runs on another one (`scripts/headless.sh` sets it to the desktop's): the keyring that encrypts the profile's cookies answers there. Unset, Chrome inherits the app's |

## Provenance

Forked on 2026-09-27 from the backend of the owner's GNOME Shell extension, Apple Music
Library, at its commit 906bfa9 (`cdp.py`, `bridge.js`, `sync.py`, now `normalize.py`, and this
README). This app has rewritten most of it since and maintains it for itself; the history is
`git log -- src/backend`.
