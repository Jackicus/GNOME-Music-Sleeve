"""Apple's answers as the library's data, and the artwork cache.

Pure functions turn Apple Music API answers into the Item, Track and shelf shapes that
README.md describes: normalize_album() and the other normalize_* functions, the search and
shelf shapers the engine's commands answer with, and group_songs_into_albums_and_artists() for
the sync. They write data, never words: counts are numbers (trackCount, durationMs,
albumCount), a shelf the app names is a key with an empty title, a missing name is '', and
the app makes and translates the words (library.py, the pages). Beside them, the artwork
cache (a file name for each artwork URL, fetching what is missing, pruning what nothing
names), library.json, and the answers the engine keeps for a day. The standard library only;
the thread pool and urllib are imported where they are used.
