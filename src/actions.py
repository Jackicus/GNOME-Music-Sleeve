"""What can be done to an album, playlist, song, station, artist or video: the window's item
actions, the menus that offer them, and what a track dragged onto a sidebar playlist does.

    actions = ItemActions(window, app)     # made once by the window; adds the win.* actions
    menu = actions.menu_for(obj)           # a Gio.Menu for an Item or a Track, or None
    menu = actions.menu_for(track, queued=True)   # the item playing's, or Up Next's
    actions.go_to(obj, 'album')            # obj's album's page ('artist': its artist's)
    actions.show_artist(obj)               # a link's artist: the library's page of them
    actions.fill_sidebar_menu(menu, item)  # a sidebar playlist's or folder's menu
    actions.drop(playlist, ref)            # a library.TrackRef dropped on a sidebar playlist

The actions, each on the window (win.*) with a GLib.Variant target "(ss)", the (kind, id) of
what it acts on (an Item's kind and id, or 'song' and a Track's id):

    item-play            the item, or a track's album or playlist from the track
    item-play-next       queued after the item playing (mk.playNext)
    item-play-later      queued at the end (mk.playLater)
    item-love            loved: a song goes into Favourite Songs
    item-unlove          the love taken back
    item-add-to-library  a catalog item added to the library
    item-go-to-album     the page of the album a song is on (related.py finds it)
    item-go-to-artist    the page of the artist a song, video or album is by
    item-open-in-browser its music.apple.com page, in the default browser (Gtk.UriLauncher)
    item-copy-link       that page's address, on the clipboard

and item-add-to-playlist, "(sss)" (playlist id, kind, id): a song or a music video added to a
library playlist. The playlists' own, each through a dialog (dialogs/playlist.py):

    item-new-playlist    a playlist named in a dialog: holding the song or video of the
                         target, or in the folder it names ('folder', 'root': the top level)
    item-rename          a playlist's name and description, or a folder's name
    item-delete          a playlist, or a folder with what is in it, once a dialog confirms

and item-remove-from-playlist, "(ssi)" (playlist id, track id, the track's index): one entry
of a playlist taken out. A target names an object the menu was built for (remembered, the
last REMEMBERED of them) or one the library has; failing both, the target's kind and id are
used as they are. Each action awaits the engine (started first when it is down and the account is
signed in, as a play request does) and confirms with a toast, or reports the EngineError
(app.report: signed out, that opens the sign-in). After a song was added to a playlist, or a
song loved or unloved, the playlist (Favourite Songs) is fetched again and merged into the
library's Item, so an open page shows the change at once.

The menus are built in code, per kind (build_menu): Play, Play Next, Play Later; Go to Album,
Go to Artist (not where the page shown is that album or artist already); Favourite and
Remove from Favourites (both, of which the menu shows the one whose action is enabled: the
actions' state says whether the item is loved), Add to Library, Add to Playlist (the
library's playlists that take songs, each folder a submenu, then New Playlist…), Remove from
Playlist (a track shown in a playlist of the user's: `container`); Open in Browser, Copy Link
(only an address anyone can open: not the web player's library routes; a library artist's is
the catalog artist's page, which the engine finds through their songs); Rename… and Delete
Playlist… or Delete Folder… (a playlist of the user's, Item.editable; a folder of theirs);
each only where it applies.

After a playlist or folder was made, renamed or deleted, the window leaves the pages of what
is gone (Window.leave), the sidebar shows a new name at once, and the library follows Apple's
listing once it shows the change (wait_listed: a new playlist takes seconds to be listed),
through the playlists pass of a sync (sync.py). A track removed has its playlist fetched again,
as an add does.
The menus of the player's queue (the item playing's in the Now Playing sheet and the player
bar, Up Next's) have no Play, which would replace the queue: activating the row plays it.
Whether an item is loved is not in the library: a menu shows what the engine said last (its
`rated` signal), and asks again (engine.rating) as it opens.

Only Gio, GLib and GObject at import time besides Gtk's UriLauncher, used when a page is
opened: tests build the menus and run the actions with a stand-in window, app and engine.
