    await player.ensure_engine()  # start a down engine when signed in (the item actions)

The properties change only from the engine's events (playbackStateDidChange,
nowPlayingItemDidChange, playbackTimeDidChange, playbackDurationDidChange,
shuffleModeDidChange, repeatModeDidChange, playbackVolumeDidChange, queueItemsDidChange,
queuePositionDidChange), plus one now_playing() (and queue()) read when the engine comes up,
so the bar follows what MusicKit does rather than what was asked; nothing here polls. A
null item clears the track only after TRACK_GRACE_MS without a new one (`track_grace_ms`;
MusicKit sends a null between queues, right before the next item), and the previous item's
position, which MusicKit reports once more after a track change, is dropped here
(TRACK_HOLD), so every view sees the same cleaned position. The queue is read again
(queue()) when an item arrives that the queue held does not hold at its index; the lyrics
are asked of the engine (lyrics(), cached on disk) once per catalog song as it starts,
never on a timer. A state or track event that arrives while a read is on its way is newer
than the read's answer, which then sets only the modes and the volume. When the engine
goes down everything resets to nothing playing, at once; so it does when the page loads a
new document (the engine's `bridgeReset` event), and now_playing() is read again for what
the new one holds.
A preview (Apple's clip of a suggested song, engine.preview()) is not the queue: MusicKit
pauses for it, and the state, the track and the times stay MusicKit's, so the bar, the sheet
and MPRIS show the queue paused, which it is. Only `preview` says a clip plays, from the
engine's previewDidChange events; it is '' again as the clip ends or stops (MusicKit playing
again stops it), and when the engine goes down or the page is reloaded.
The commands raise EngineError as the engine does; play() starts a down engine first when the
account is signed in (a toast says so) and raises EngineError('not-signed-in') when it is not,
which the window turns into the sign-in flow. `error(message)` is emitted for MusicKit's
mediaPlaybackError, with the sentence playback_error_text() gives its code (the app toasts
it as it is; the code and MusicKit's text go to the log). GObject only, no GTK: tests feed
it synthetic events.
