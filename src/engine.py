Properties `state` ('down', 'starting', 'up', 'signing-in'), `authorized`, `headless`; the
`event(name, data)` signal re-emits the bridge's MusicKit events (name without the 'am:'
prefix), and `rated(kind, id, value)` follows love(), unlove() and rating() (the kind and id
as they were asked, value 1 loved, 0 not), so a heart shows what a menu did, and
`lost(reason)` says the engine went down on its own (Chrome crashed or was killed, the page
crashed, closed or stopped answering), never for a stop, a restart or quitting. Every failure
is an EngineError; nothing here blocks the loop: Chrome is a Gio.Subprocess (awaitable
wait_async), the connection is the asynchronous CDPClient over Chrome's DevTools pipe (its
descriptors 3 and 4: no port is open), and the JSON shaping and artwork HTTP of item() run in
a thread. In demo mode (`demo=True`) start() and stop() do nothing and every command raises
EngineError('engine-down') at once, but for a kept answer the demo library invented
(scripts/demo_library.py writes its artists' pages, marked `demo`), answered from its cache.

The browser command (`browser_command`) and the preferred mode (`prefer_headless`) are read
when Chrome is spawned, so a change applies at the next start and a running Chrome is left
alone. APPLE_MUSIC_DEBUG_PORT, when set, also opens DevTools on that port of 127.0.0.1 for a
developer's debug CLI to attach to, with a warning at every start. What the cache holds and
how it is cleared is src/cache.py's.

Chrome's session bus is the app's, or APPLE_MUSIC_HOST_SESSION_BUS when that is set
(scripts/headless.sh sets it to the desktop's while the app runs on a private one): the
keyring holding the key that encrypts the profile's cookies answers there. A start on a
profile whose Local State records that key (chrome.profile_used_keyring) first checks that
org.freedesktop.secrets is up on that bus, or comes up when asked, and is
EngineError('no-keyring') otherwise, Chrome never spawned: without its key Chrome deletes the
cookies it cannot decrypt, the sign-in among them.
