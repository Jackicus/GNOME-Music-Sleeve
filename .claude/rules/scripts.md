# Developer scripts

- `run.sh`, `check.sh` and `demo.sh` share one build directory, `build/`, set up with the
  development profile and the prefix `build/install`; run.sh and check.sh reconfigure it back
  if something set it up otherwise. Keep a release build in its own directory (`_build/`).
- The in-process scripts (screenshot.py, a11y_check.py, scroll_test.py, bench.py) run the
  installed build (run `scripts/demo.sh` or `meson install -C build` first) through
  `harness.make_app()`: the installed modules and translations, GSettings on the memory backend
  with engine-autostart off, the demo library (build/demo, written again when out of date, or
  `APPLE_MUSIC_CACHE`; screenshot.py only with `--demo`), an app ID of their own, asyncio on the GLib loop, a fixed dark or light
  scheme, and windows made non-resizable so a tiling window manager keeps `--size`. Call
  `make_app()` before importing Gtk. A new in-process script starts through the harness too: the
  scripts' app runs as the release profile, and the harness is what keeps it from starting a real
  Chrome.
- `headless.sh COMMAND…` runs a command on a private, invisible display: a headless mutter with a
  virtual monitor (`HEADLESS_SIZE`, default 1920x1080) in its own D-Bus session, with `DISPLAY`
  unset. Run every GUI script through it (screenshot.py, a11y_check.py, scroll_test.py,
  bench.py, the widget tests) so no window opens on, or takes focus from, the user's desktop, and
  the app's MPRIS player never reaches the real session. Compare timings only with other
  headless runs. mutter owns `org.gnome.Mutter.RemoteDesktop` on that private session, which is
  where `remote_keys.py` gets real key presses from; CI has no mutter, so nothing in check.sh
  may depend on it. Chrome is the one thing it sends back to the desktop: before
  `dbus-run-session`, it records the desktop's session bus as `APPLE_MUSIC_HOST_SESSION_BUS`
  (the address in the environment, else `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bus`; a nested run keeps the
  outer's), which the engine gives Chrome as its `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`, so Chrome reaches
  the desktop's keyring, where the key that encrypts its profile's cookies is. Without it, a
  Chrome on a signed-in profile deletes those cookies (the sign-in with them) and the engine
  refuses to start one (engine.md). tests/test_headless.py checks the export with stand-ins.
- screenshot.py and a11y_check.py also use the stock GNOME look (Adwaita icons, Adwaita Sans 11)
  and no animations, so shots do not depend on the desktop's theme.
- `screenshot.py` without `--demo` reads the release build's real cache (`APPLE_MUSIC_CACHE`
  names the .Devel build's): never for a shot that is committed or shared. `--now-playing
  [lyrics|queue]` opens the sheet on an invented item; `--playing` puts the item on the Player
  with the sheet closed (the bar's playing state); both need `--demo`. `--signed-in [NAME]`,
  `--banner sign-in|expired` and `--sidebar` (the narrow layout's sidebar) show those states;
  `--help` lists the rest. It shoots once no artwork decode has been in flight for a few polls
  (5 s at most), so a new step that shows artwork needs no delay of its own for it.
- `a11y_check.py` sends real key presses: `remote_keys.py` starts a session on the headless
  mutter's `org.gnome.Mutter.RemoteDesktop` and injects each key by its evdev keycode, which it
  works out from the accelerator through the display's own keymap; it presses Shift alone first,
  since the compositor points the keyboard at a window only once it has an event for it, and
  until then the window is not active and the first key is lost. That active window is what lets
  the walkthrough cover Tab from row to row and Down from one sidebar section to the next.
  `--emulate-keys`, and any session without that interface (a desktop one puts it behind the
  remote-desktop portal), falls back to `press()`, which runs the controllers a real event would
  reach, a label's mnemonic included, and leaves those steps out. A dialog is inside the window only while that is
  maximized (or tiled), so the dialog step maximizes it and puts it back. `--names` runs a private
  AT-SPI bus (a dbus-daemon and at-spi2-registryd) and stops it however the script exits.
- `am.py` drives the real engine: `status`, `eval`, `now-playing`, `events`. By default each
  command starts a Chrome of its own on the release build's profile (`--devel` for the .Devel
  build's, `APPLE_MUSIC_PROFILE` over both) through the app's Engine, over the pipe, headless
  unless `--visible`, and stops it when done: there is no start or stop. While the app's Chrome
  holds the profile, `status` says so and the rest refuse. `--attach [PORT]` drives the running
  app instead, which must have been started with `APPLE_MUSIC_DEBUG_PORT` (a bare `--attach`
  reads that variable). One JSON value per command, or `{"error": code, "message": …}` and
  exit 1. It never signs in. Its Chrome is the app's Engine's, so it gets
  `APPLE_MUSIC_HOST_SESSION_BUS` and the keyring check the same way: inside headless.sh it
  keeps the profile's sign-in, and without a keyring on Chrome's bus it answers `no-keyring`.
- `demo_library.py` writes invented data only and, without options, the same library every
  time: tests and the metainfo screenshots depend on both. Its last write is `.demo-stamp`, a
  hash of `demo_stamp.SOURCES` (the script, the backend's normalize.py and config.py) and of
  the options it was given; the harness and `demo.sh` write build/demo again whenever
  `demo_stamp.py build/demo` says it is missing or out of date (an older checkout's demo lacks
  what newer steps open, such as an artist's Top Songs). A new source the demo's output
  depends on goes in `SOURCES`.
- Scripts may print; app code logs.
